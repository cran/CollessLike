\title{Computes the Colless-like balance index of a phylogenetic tree}
\usage{
colless.like.index(tree, f.size = "ln", diss = "MDM", norm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{a single phylogenetic tree. It can be entered as a string in Newick format, as a 'phylo' object (\code{ape} package) or as an 'igraph' object (\code{igraph} package).}

\item{f.size}{function to compute the f-size of the tree. See (Mir et al. , 2017) for details. Its default value is "ln" for f(n)=ln(n+e). Other value can be "exp" (f(n)=exp(n)). It can also be a user-defined function but in this case, the index cannot be normalized}

\item{diss}{by default, the dissimilarity used to compute the balance index. See (Mir et al. , 2017) for details. Its default value is MDM (mean deviation from the median). Other values can be set as "sd" (sample standard deviation) or "var" (sample variance) . It can also be a user-defined function but in this case the index cannot be normalized.}

\item{norm}{a logical object indicating if the indices should be normalized or not.}
}
\value{
A numeric value.
}
\description{
Given a phylogenetic tree, computes the Colless-like balance index of that phylogenetic tree.
}
\details{
The Colless-Like balance index is the generalization of the Colless balance index (see Colless,1982) for non-binary trees.

Given a function that computes the f-size of a tree and a dissimarity function that computes the difference of the f-sizes of the subtrees rooted at the children of every internal node of the tree, the Colless-Like index is defined as the sum of these dissimilarities for all internal nodes of the tree. (Mir et al. , 2017)

By default, the f-size function is \code{f(n)=exp(n)} and the dissimilarity is the mean deviation from the median (MDM). 
It is possible to change them by specifying it with the parameters \code{f.size} and \code{diss}, with "exp" the f-size would be \code{f(n)=exp(n)}, and with "var" (or "sd") the dissimilarity would be the sample variance (or the sample standard deviation).
It is also possible to set a new function for both parameters, see "References".
